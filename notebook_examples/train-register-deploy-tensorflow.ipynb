    "## Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TensorFlowModel` class in Accelerated Data Science (ADS) is designed to allow you to rapidly get a model into production. The `.prepare()` method creates the model artifacts that are needed to deploy a functioning model without you having to configure it or write code. However, it does allow you to customize the `score.py` file as needed. Simulate a call to a deployed model with the `.verify()` method. This method calls the `load_model()` and `predict()` functions in the `score.py` file. Using `.verify()` allows you to debug your `score.py` file without having to deploy a model. The `.save()` method pushes your `TensorFlowModel` and the model artifacts to the model catalog. The `.deploy()` method deploys the model to a REST endpoint for you. Finally, the `.predict()` method allows you to call the endpoint to perform model inference.\n",
